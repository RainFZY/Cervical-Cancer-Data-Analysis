# CERVICAL CANCER RISK ANALYSIS
## Introduction

*AI Camp - The Data Science Crash Course Project*

- In this project, we applied techniques of Machine Learning and Data Science to identify behavioral patterns of Cervical Cancer, which put women at a greater risk. Feature importance will be leveraged to construct risk profiles, generation of such risk profiles will help healthcare institutions/doctors to identify at risk individuals who should receive immediate attention and a more tailored health plan.

- Coding Language: Python for ML/DS, Flask; Javascript/HTML/CSS for bootstrap.

- ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost.

- Dataset: [Cervical Cancer Data](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=42912&status=active)
